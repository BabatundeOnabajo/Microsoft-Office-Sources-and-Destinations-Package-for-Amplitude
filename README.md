# Microsoft-Office-Destinations-for-Amplitude
Up until the point of creating this repository, Amplitude - the digital analytics company headquarted in the United States and founded in 2014 - offered a wide range of sources and destinations ranging from Amazon Web Services (AWS) through to Shopify. However, there was no clear or apparent source/destination for Microsoft Office.  

# Instructions

# Requirements

# Technology
Broadly speaking, there are two ways to create a Microsoft Office add-in: in **node.js** or in **Visual Studio**. Microsoft recommends building add-ins in node.js as opposed to Visual Studio, however, because the node.js environment is updated more frequently than that in Visual Studio.
