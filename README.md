# Microsoft-Office-Destinations-for-Amplitude
Up until the point of creating this repository, Amplitude - the digital analytics company headquarted in the United States and founded in 2014 - offered a wide range of sources and destinations ranging from Amazon Web Services (AWS) through to Shopify. However, there was no clear or apparent source/destination for Microsoft Office.  

# Instructions

# Requirements

# Technology
Broadly speaking, there are two ways to create a Microsoft Office add-in: in **node.js** or in **Visual Studio**. Microsoft recommends building add-ins in node.js as opposed to Visual Studio, however, because the node.js environment and templates is updated more frequently than that in Visual Studio. Furthermore, using Visual Studio restricts you to developing on Windows machines. And perhaps finally, using Visual Studio requires you to write the server-end language in **ASP.NET**. For all of these reasons, and more, it was determined it was best to build this repository using node.js.
